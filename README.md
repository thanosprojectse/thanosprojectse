# Machine Learning From Scratch

Python implementations of various Machine Learning models and algorithms from scratch using numpy.

Some matrix and vector operations such as calculations of covariance and correlation matricies are
implemented by hand even though there are numpy methods that enable these computations. 

The purpose of this repository is purely self-educational.

##Current implementations:
####Supervised Learning:
- Linear Regression
- Multilayer Perceptron
- Perceptron
- K Nearest Neighbor
- Adaboost
- Naive Bayes
- Logistic Regression

####Unsupervised Learning:
- Principal Component Analysis
- Linear Discriminant Analysis

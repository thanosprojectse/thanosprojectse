# Machine Learning From Scratch

Python implementations of various Machine Learning models and algorithms from scratch using numpy.

Some matrix and vector operations such as calculations of covariance and correlation matricies are
implemented by hand even though there are numpy methods that enable these computations. 

The purpose of this project is purely self-educational.

##Current implementations:
####Supervised Learning:
- Linear Regression
- Ridge Regression
- Multilayer Perceptron
- Perceptron
- K Nearest Neighbors
- Adaboost
- Naive Bayes
- Logistic Regression
- Linear Discriminant Analysis
- Multi-class Linear Discriminant Analysis
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
- Support Vector Machine

####Unsupervised Learning:
- Principal Component Analysis
- K-Means
- Gaussian Mixture Model
